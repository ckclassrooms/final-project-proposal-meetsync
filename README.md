What does your application do?

Current Google/Outlook functionality to create a meeting for multiple people with multiple schedules is a hassle. Our application aims to synchronise calendars of 
members who would be added to a meeting according to when they are available. Accessing all the calendar information in one spot will make creating and making 
a decision on scheduling the meeting easier. As per our knowledge, such an application does not exist as of now. 


What makes it different than a CRUD app? I.e., what functionality does it provide that is not just a user interface layer on top of a database of user information, and the ability to view / add to / change that information?

What security and privacy concerns do you expect you (as developers) or your users to have with this application?
