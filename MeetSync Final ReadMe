Final Project Report for CS 484 - MeetSync

Our final project for CS 484 utilises the following technologies 
- an OAuth Screen for Login that utilises Supabase,
- A QR Code generator to redirect to the Time Picker page,
- This allows a user to pick a date time and input their Google Calendar ID. (This is their publicly available ID  for any public Calendar)
  
  Steps to get your own public Calendar ID: 
   Go into Calendar->Select your calendar (make sure it's public)->Settings and Sharing->Integrate Calendar.
   Link to the same steps: https://docs.simplecalendar.io/find-google-calendar-id/
   
- On submitting this information their Google Calendar events are fetched and stored via a react UseState, each event is mapped to screen.
  You can see the multiple events listed for multiple users along with if their meeting begins at the picked time , i.e., if they are busy at the time.
  Currently we have one existing user in the team, and a visiting user can enter their own Calendar ID to compare Calendars.
  
 - Finally if none of the users are busy they can head into the Google meet Page - which redirects them to schedule a meeting.

 Overall we have implemented an app that goes above CRUD functionality and collates information from users to query the Authorised Google Calendar API, deploying to Netlify !.
